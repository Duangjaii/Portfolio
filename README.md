# About me
I have a strong coordination, organization and problem solving, due to my background as project coordinator, middle and high school tutor, elementary school teacher and seller that give me the opportunity to communicate with many kinds and generations of people. I have a strong curiosity that makes me eager to learn many things and love working in a team. Moreover, attention to detail is my strong trait for example as the Thai design jewelry shop owner, my products are handmade gold and silver jewelry, so all products are detailed and delicate work that I have to check precisely before selling to customers.

After I gathered the feedback of customers from the bank products, and Iâ€™ve found many problems about technologies like mobile banking application. These problems make a lot of bad effects, therefore I realized that how important the software tester are in the a rapidly-progressive technology. 

Currently, I am intensively studying software tester techniques and tools by attending online courses, reading many article from blogs and Facebook group, watching free online courses from YouTube and asking my software developer friend for more information.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal.
